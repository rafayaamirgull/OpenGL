# OpenGL Kernels and APIs for Computer Vision

This repository contains C++, CUDA, and Python kernels and APIs for OpenGL shaders and graphics, primarily focused on computer vision applications. The goal is to provide efficient and flexible implementations that leverage GPU acceleration for advanced graphics and vision tasks.

## Repository Structure

- `cpp/` - C++ kernels and APIs for OpenGL shader programming and graphics utilities.
- `cuda/` - CUDA kernels and utilities for GPU-accelerated graphics and vision processing.
- `python/` - Python bindings and APIs to interact with OpenGL shaders and graphics pipelines.

> **Note:** The directories may be populated progressively as the project evolves.

## Getting Started

This repository aims to provide reusable components for OpenGL-based graphics and computer vision workflows. Typical usage involves compiling the C++ and CUDA kernels and using the Python APIs for integration and experimentation.

Build instructions and usage examples will be provided as the project develops.
